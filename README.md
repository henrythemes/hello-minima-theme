# Hello, Minima! Theme - Get Started in 60 Seconds

Setup Jekyll with GitHub Pages in 60 seconds using Minima - the gem-packaged theme.

### Step 1 - Create the Jekyll Configuration / Settings File

Add your site title e.g. Your Site Title and let's use the minima theme

`_config.yml`:

```
title: Your Site Title

theme: minima
```

### Step 2 - Create the Index Page

Add your index (front) page with a page title e.g. Welcome and using the default layout (built into Mimina and ready-to-use "out-of-the-gem"):


`index.md`:

```
---
title: Welcome
layout: default
---

Hello, Minima!
```

That's it. Ready for serving.

Go on GitHub in your repos **Settings** tab to the **GitHub Pages** sections and pick **Use the master branch** in **Select Source**.
Save. Enjoy. Happy Jekylling!
